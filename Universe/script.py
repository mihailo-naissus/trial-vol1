### another version with numpy (still not fast!)
# import numpy as np


# import matplotlib.pylab as plt
# atoms=[]
# window_size = 300
# center = window_size/2

# mat = np.zeros((window_size, window_size))
# for y in range(window_size):
#     for x in range(window_size):
#         dx = (x-center)/1000-0.12
#         dy = (y-center)/1000-0.82
#         a = dx
#         b = dy
#         for t in range(50):
#             d = (a*a)-(b*b)+dx
#             b = 2*(a*b)+dy
#             a = d
#             H = d > 200
#             if(H==True):
#                 mat[y, x] = t


# plt.imshow(mat)
