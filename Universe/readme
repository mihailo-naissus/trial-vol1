Mandelbrot Set Visualization
This program generates a visualization of the Mandelbrot set using two different approaches: a simple, slow method using matplotlib.pylab and a slightly faster method using numpy.

How to Use
To generate the Mandelbrot set visualization using the simple method, run the following command in your terminal:
Copy code
python script.py
To generate the visualization using the faster method with numpy, uncomment the relevant lines of code in the script and run the command again.

Example Output
Here is an example of the Mandelbrot set visualization generated by the simple method:

Requirements
Python 3.6 or later
matplotlib and numpy (for the faster method)
